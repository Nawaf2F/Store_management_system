# Store Management System

The task is to build a Store management system. To manage the store, we need to work
with three parts: users, products and stores.

---
## Users
The users in the store management system has the name, ID (generated automatically in
a sequence from 1000). The system works with two kinds of users:
1. Employee has a salary. In addition, we can update the salary and increase it with a
specific percentage as a bonus.

2. Customer holds how many times he/she visits (buys from) the store. A customer is
called a new customer if he/she visits the store one or two times. In the other cases,
he/she is called a special customer.

---
## Products

Each product has a name, price, ID (generated automatically). There is a special kind of
product called Special-Products. These special products have a relation between each
other, e.g. the same offer, can buy together â€¦ etc. Each Special-Products has the name of
this relationship and has a list of these Special-Products. Make sure, in the final, you can
get the same list of Special-Products by using any special product in this list.

## Store

Each store has a name and a list of products in that store. Assume that it has 100 products
as a maximum size. The store can do different functionalities:
1. isExist: to decide whether a specific product is available/exist in the store or not.

2. addProduct: to decide whether can add a specific product in the store or not. It
must add that product if it is possible.
 
3. removeProduct: to decide whether can remove a specific product in the store or
not. It must remove that product if it is already in the store.

4. totalPrice: calculates the total price of a specific list of products chosen by the user
(part of the main products in the store). Make sure, you will give a discount 25%
only for a special customer.

5. buy: to manipulate a complete buy operation for a specific user and a specific list
of products(part of the main products in the store). Make sure he/she can buy
only an exist product, remove it from store, then print the final information
included the total price

## Additional

A manager is an employee. He/she can remove a chosen product from the store directly
without needing to a buy operation. If the employee is a manager, your system opens a
special window. This window displays the current products in the store and asks the
manager to enter the product ID. A resulted message appears after clicking to tell the
manager whether the product was removed or not.

---
## The system must include

1. Constructors for all classes.
2. Final concept for all possible classes, all possible methods and at least two
instance variables.
3. Static variable.
4. Access modifier: Private for all variables except interface or abstract (protected).
5. Setter and getter methods if you need them.
6. Array of your classes in the core classes and test class.
7. Composition concept.
8. Inheritance concept with override methods.
9. Interface or abstract concepts.
10. Upcasting and downcasting polymorphism.
11. Graphical user interface (GUI)
